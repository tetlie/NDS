              The Northern Drawing School (NDS) – Network for Analogue and
              Artistic Drawing in Higher Education, in the Nordic and Baltic
              Region (and elsewhere)
            </p>
            <p>
              From the Renaissance until the end of the 20th century, drawing
              was the foundation of all artistic education in the Western World.
              The word design comes from Latin and means to draw. Contrary to
              what the public might think, drawing today has a very subordinate
              role in design and art education. In the name of Modernity, and a
              style called Modernism (and Post Modernism), what was based on the
              testimony of the eye and the knowledge of the hand was replaced by
              abstractions and theorizing. The Northern Drawing School
              postulates that a reinforcement of the practice of drawing in
              artistic educations will improve the understanding for how
              cognitive and sensorial impulses manifest in the abstract
              expression, and how the innate potential within this process can
              change its outcome.
